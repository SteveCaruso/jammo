# Jammo!
A quick, light-weight vanilla javascript templating system.

*Jammo!* – pronounced "YAHM-muh" – is Neapolitan for "let's go!" (the cognate of the standard Italian *andiamo*). Most folk know the word from the old song *Funiculì, funiculà*.

*Jammo* is built in vanilla Javascript and is designed to be stupidly lightweight.
